##### We know that a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or in some cases Dense fully connected layers 
(MLP — Multi layer perceptron as some would like to call it) can be used to perform image recognition. But, a CNN (or MLP)
alone cannot be used to perform tasks like content and style separation from an image, generate real looking images (a generative model),
classify images using a very small set of labeled or perform data compression (like zipping a file).
